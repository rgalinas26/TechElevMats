      "It certainly is a book. I mean, I can see that. Pages kept together with glue (I hope that's glue) and there's writing on it, in some language.",

    reviewer: 'Tim Ferriss',
    title: 'Had a cigar party started in less than 4 hours.',

    review:
      "When I sell my courses, I'm always telling people that if a book costs less than $20, they should just buy it. If they only learn one thing from it, it was worth it. Wish I learned something from this book.",
